mxgraph
=======

mxGraph is a fully client side JavaScript diagramming library that uses SVG and HTML for rendering. It is the underlying technology that powers the drawing functionality that you see in [draw.io](https://www.draw.io). The [sources to draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io) are also available.

mxGraph supports IE 9+, Chrome 30+, Firefox 31+, Safari versions actively patched by Apple (6.2.x, 7.1.x, 8.0.x and 9.x at time of writing), Opera 20+, Native Android browser 5.x+, the default browser in the current and previous major iOS versions (e.g. 9.x and 8.x) and Edge 20+.

mxGraph uses no third-party software, it requires no plugins and can be integrated in virtually any framework. Also provided is server-side functionality in Java and .NET for persistence (open and save) functionality, as well as server-side image generation.
